<H2>1</H2>. if somebody leave the lobby or doesn't want to play, 
  I'll ask to other 3 players if they want to continue playing 
  and which player to remove from the team in order to add another one.
  Otherwise nobody get removed and we will play the next day.
</div>
  <br></br>
<div>
 <H2>2</H2>. for the player that will get removed: 
  I'm not going to remove you from my friend list,
  in case we need another player and you are online,
  I'll ask you if you want to join us(again).
  ofcourse not being in a team your reward counter didn't change,
  so: I'll continue playing untill you get all the rewards.
