<br></br>
<div>
<strong>1.</strong> It doesn't matter if the Player gets points for the Clan or not.
</div>
<div>
<strong>2.</strong> Important is to LogIn once in awhile,playing is optional.
</div>
<div>
<strong>3.</strong> The Player that has not LogIn for 5 or 6 days will be removed from the Clan.
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;•5 days for players that has 0 or few points.
</div>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;•6 days for players that has been active in the last week.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<strong>4.</strong> You don't have to do nothing for the Clan, just play the games you like.
</div>
<br></br>
<H2>Note:</H2>
<div>
Do not ask to join the Clan if the Clan is full.
I can't remove a Player if He/She doesn't break the Rules.

<H2>Tips:</H2>
<div>
● When the game countdown starts,stop it at 3,and try again,
I've noticed that if the game starts at 0,1,2,3 the players(enemy) are weaker or bots,
maybe this is my impression, but this is what I do.
<br></br>
● If you play with a Friend or a Clan_Member(I didn't try with other online players),
there are more chances to play against bots/weaker players.
<br></br>
● Choose your favorite weapon and try to improve it,
without a purpose the game starts to get a bit boring.
<br></br>
● Play smaller maps like Shipment/Crash/Nuketown,
on bigger maps you will waste your time running,,ecc...
<br></br>
● For Xp Cards play Zombies->Hard,
it lasts 30 minutes and you can get 32 cards,
and if you want you can unlock Aether Crystal camo.
